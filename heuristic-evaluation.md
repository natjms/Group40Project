### No way to cancel review
- Heuristic: User Control & Freedom
- Severity: 4
- Description: Once I enter the "Leave a review" task, I can't cancel writing a review. This might happen if I realize I'm reviewing the wrong property.
- Proposal: Add a button that just takes me back to the previous screen.

### Unclear what's going on while identity is being verified

- Heuristic: Visibility of System Status
- Severity: 2
- Description: When I send the email to the account verification team, I'm taken to a loading page. To this point I feel like I'm in control of the process but when I get here, obviously it's out of my hands, but the change may be a bit jarring.
- Proposal: To improve this, the design team should add some more text that gets updated as updates come in. Like, maybe at first it says "The team is receiving the documents," then "Your documents are being analyzed," and if something goes wrong, then I get to know immediately.

### Inconsistent and technical language while "verifying"
- Heuristic: Matching
- Severity: 1
- Description: It's unclear what specifically this task is doing. First I'm told my identity is being verified, then it seems like the team is trying to prove I own the properties I supposedly listed in my application, and then it's my "application" that's being verified...
- Proposal: I think you should stick to one phrasing, most accurately, something to the effect of "proving I own the properties," since that's very concrete and immediately gives me a good idea of what documents I need to send in

### Can't stop writing review once I've started?
- Heuristic: User Control & Freedom
- Severity: 4
- Description: I'm only given the option to publish my review.
- Proposal: I should be able to cancel this and go back to the main page.

### Can't retry when my application was rejected
- Heuristic: User Control & Freedom
- Severity: 4
- Description: When I test having my application get rejected, I only get the "Finish" button.
- Proposal: This is clearly an "error state" and I'd feel more empowered if I'm given the option to try again immediately. So, the UI needs a retry button.

### What documentation can I send?
- Heuristic: Help & Documentation
- Severity: 3
- Description: The blurb discussion how to get my account approved doesn't tell me what documents the account verification team will accept.
- Proposal: This should be amended to list some types of documents they would accept.

### It's not obvious no results have been found when searching for an unrecognized property

- Heuristic: Visibility of System Status
- Severity: 2
- Description: When I type some text into the search bar and there's no property found, the predictive search box just disappears.
- Proposal: It'd be more clear what's happening here if there was some kind of "No properties found!" message

### No matches when I've input less than 3 characters or so

- Heuristic: Visibility of System Status
- Severity: 3
- Description: When my search query is less than 3 characters, it looks like there's no results even when there should be.
- Proposal: Matching results should be shown immediately.

### Insufficient documentation on what I need to send
- Heuristic: Help & Documentation
- Severity: 3
- Description: I know that I need to send some documentation. What documentation specifically? How do I send it? (It's not explicit in the text that I need to email it)
- Proposal: List solid examples of applicable documents, and explicitly state they're going to be recieved by email.

### Missing iconography for "Compose Email" button
- Heuristic: Consistency & Standards
- Severity: 1
- Description: The button to open your email client just says "Compose Email." In the larger context of this page, it's not super clear how the process works. You're just registering your account, then all of a sudden you're in your email client, and then people are looking over your documents. There's other related issues here, but one thing stands out is that it could be more obvious where this button is going to take me
- Proposal: Add an email icon to the button.
